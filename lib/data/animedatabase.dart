              "Thirty-seven-year-old Satoru Mikami is a typical corporate worker, who is perfectly content with his monotonous lifestyle in Tokyo, other than failing to nail down a girlfriend even once throughout his life",
              " In the midst of a casual encounter with his colleague, he falls victim to a random assailant on the streets and is stabbed",
              " However, while succumbing to his injuries, a peculiar voice echoes in his mind, and recites a bunch of commands which the dying man cannot make sense of",
              "When Satoru regains consciousness, he discovers that he has reincarnated as a goop of slime in an unfamiliar realm",
              " In doing so, he acquires newfound skills—notably, the power to devour anything and mimic its appearance and abilities",
              " He then stumbles upon the sealed Catastrophe-level monster Storm Dragon Veldora who had been sealed away for the past 300 years for devastating a town to ashes",
              " Sympathetic to his predicament, Satoru befriends him, promising to assist in destroying the seal",
              " In return, Veldora bestows upon him the name Rimuru Tempest to grant him divine protection",
              " Now, liberated from the mundanities of his past life, Rimuru embarks on a fresh journey with a distinct goal in mind",
              " As he grows accustomed to his new physique, his gooey antics ripple throughout the world, gradually altering his fate",

              " Also at odds with her goal is the fact that Anis is incapable of using magic despite her noble status",
              " Refusing to give up so easily, she renounces her right to the throne, and focuses on developing magicology by combining various resources with knowledge from her previous life on Earth",
              "Due to Anis nature, responsibility for the kingdoms future is passed onto her younger brother, Algard",
              " Pushed into a political marriage with Euphyllia Magenta, a girl he hardly knows, Algard rebels by spending more time with a commoner girl than his fiancée",
              " After Euphyllia tries to intervene, Algard publicly calls off their marriage and denounces his ex-fiancée as a bully",
              "After crashing into the banquet where Algard makes the announcement, Anis rescues Euphyllia on the flying broom she is testing",
              " She decides to make Euphyllia her assistant, which the other girl reluctantly agrees to",
              " Although their partnership appears random at first, Anis has an ulterior motive for wanting Euphyllias company",

              "Claiming to be a legendary detective, Siesta enlists Kimizuka to be her sidekick",
              " Though Kimizuka refuses at first, with Siestas insistence, he eventually joins her—marking the start of a grand adventure spanning the entire world, preventing multiple threats that could spell doom for humanity along the way",

              " Distraught, Kimizuka tries to leave all memories of her behind, but as he begins to meet more people, it seems that Siestas influence will never truly die",
