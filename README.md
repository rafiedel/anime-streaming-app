## Anime Streaming App

This app was built for self-exercises to learn how to use HTTP and fetch data from APIs. In this case, I built an Anime Streaming App with data (link of video) from MuseAsia and used the `youtube_player_flutter` package to display the video.

### Third-party Packages Used:

- **youtube_player_flutter:** ^8.1.2
- **http:** ^0.13.4
- **html:** ^0.15.0
- **jikan_api:** ^2.1.0
- **animeflv:** ^0.0.6
- **provider:** ^6.1.1
- **azlistview:** ^2.0.0
- **sticky_headers:** ^0.3.0+2
- **card_swiper:** ^3.0.1
- **palette_generator:** ^0.3.3+3
- **popover:** ^0.2.9
- **flutter_swiper_view:** ^1.1.8

### How does the app work:

1. **Run the actual app:**
   - To run the app, execute the `main.dart` file.

2. **Get the data:**
   - Run the app from `youtube.dart`.
   - Wait until a button shows on the screen.
   - Manually print the data and copy-paste it into the `database.dart`.

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that you have proper internet connectivity to fetch data from the APIs.
- Make sure to check for any updates or changes in the third-party packages used in the app.
